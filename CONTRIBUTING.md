## Adding Templates

In the [`data/templates`](data/templates) directory, use the example to create your own template directory. The name of the directory will be the primary alias for that meme.

The `regexes` list is used for pattern matching on http://memegen.link/magic. If you are not comfortable writing regular expressions, please leave this list empty. Otherwise, add a few [tests](https://github.com/jacebrowning/memegen/blob/master/tests/test_magic.py) to confirm the expected patterns match.

### Serving

Run the server locally:

```sh
$ make run
```

or also launch it in your browser:

```sh
$ make launch
```

### Validation

Run the checks to ensure your new template does not conflict with others:

```sh
$ make validate
```

### Pull Request

After checks pass, create a pull request to be merged after review.
